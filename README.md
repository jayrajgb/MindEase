MindEase --- A Mental Health Monitoring Platform

Developed under "WEB TECHNOLOGY" course as a semester-long project in VIT, Pune.

The project was contributed by students of VIT, including Jayraj Borate, Tanaya Dahatonde, and Nivedita Dannalli.

The project explores new web technologies through its implementation, providing useful application and user-freindly interface.

Thanks!
